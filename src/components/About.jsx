                <p className="hero-left-text">We are family owned Meditteranian restaurant, located on Maldove Street in Chicago, Illinois. We focus on traditional recipes served with modern twist. Founded in 1980 by the idea of our father
                who wanted to do something different. He missed mother cusine, so he got an idea to open an restaurant in her memory. The name comes from the fact, that lemon was always the part of our family
                life. From lemodande to lemonade cakes. Our mother loved lemonade. So we found this appropriate to named our first restaurant as "Little Lemonade". We hope that you will enyoing our dishes. Welcome!.</p>
